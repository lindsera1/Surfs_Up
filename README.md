# Surfs Up Analysis With W. Avy

## Purpose of Analysis

A friend of mine visited Hawaii last year, and fell in love with the culture there; he wanted to bring to life an idea that would
allow him to live in Hawaii forever, by starting a Surf 'n Shake shop, serving ice cream and surfboards to all people in Oahu. Since
this is such a large investment, he needed to get the help of some investors to get it off the ground. In particular one investor, 
W. Avy, is very concered about the year round weather patterns. To help make a better informed decision, we conducted analysis on 
every dimension of temperature, rainfall, and the stations which recorded that data. Let's look at what we found. 

## Results

### The Month of June

We wanted to gain insight into the weather of two polar opposite months: June and December. Starting with June, we were able to 
extract the following information:

+ Less than 3 inches of average rainfall
+ A maximum temperature of 85F
+ A minimum temperature of 64F
+ An average temperature of 75F

This was good new for the temperatures reported; W. Avy was satisfied with the rainfall conditions.

### The Month of December

We wanted to see how a month on the opposite side of the calendar would perform relatively, to see if this business idea was a  
sustainable one year round. 

+ Less than 3 inches of rainfall
+ A maximum temperature of 83
+ A minimum temperature of 56
+ An average temperature of 71F

Based on these results, we can see the following differences:

1.  An average drop of about 6 degrees, however I couldn't imagine the difference would be 
very noticeable. 
2. There is greater variance in the minimum and maximum ranges, close to 10 degrees in the difference between maximum and minimum
temperatures for the months of June and December. 
3. A low of 56 in December and a low of 64 in June could potentially mean less business in a few days of the year; 56 is not exactly 
surfing weather, and more people may decide to stay in. However, it does not appear that this is the trend, so I don't believe 
W. Avy and my friend should have many problems succeeding in their venture. 

## Summary

After agreeing with the weather data looking at the rainfall, and then analyzing two different months to see temperature variance, 
the weather in Oahu seems very stable. Out of interest, I would be interested to see weather data for temperature up to five years
back, to just get an idea for how consistent these data points are. Another potential query would look at daylight; were sunny days
neccesarily more rain free? Did it impact temperature or is there any correlation? These could provide more insight into how the new
shop might perform.
